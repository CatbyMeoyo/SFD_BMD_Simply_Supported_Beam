# SFD and BMD of Simply Supported Beam
A MATLAB function that plots the Shear Force and Bending Moment Diagrams of  a simply supported beam.

Sfunc is the  main  function for simply supported beams which takes in  inputs and processes the inputs. The sub functions of this functions are, pointl, udl, anduvl, which calculates shear force and bending  momentand plots them  for point loads, uniformly distributed loads and  uniformly varying  loads  respectively.These  functions work  without  the  main  function,  but do  not  work properly.This  function should work  for  various combinations  for point  loads, distributed loads and varying loads if implemented correctly.
